      "description": "A man looks up from a drain which he is unblocking on the streets of Kolkata --- Coastal cities in India, such as Kolkata and Mumbai, have been identified as some of the most at risk to climate change effects, such as rising sea levels. In late 2016 however, Kolkata was named as one of the 11 best cities in the world for addressing the effects of climate change at the C40 Mayor's Summit in Mexico City. \"Kolkata’s climate change risks have been exacerbated by unsanitary disposal and waste dumping...[The city's] project aims to eradicate open dumping and burning of waste and to limit the concentration of methane gas generated in landfill sites.\" A promising step for one of the world's most vulnerable cities. --- @natgeocreative @pulitzercenter --- #asia #india #kolkata #pollution #water #environment",
