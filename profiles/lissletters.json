I'm hopeless at remembering to share all the things) But, because I'm legit excited about these new designs I've decided to do a giveaway!!! To enter, all you have to do is tell me which one of these five you LOVE, and I'll choose one comment randomly and send you that cover for your phone! 📱\nYou can see the rest of the collection at liss.com.au/casetify - and I'm pretty sure there's a special running at the moment for Mother's Day so it's a great time to buy if you can't possibly wait to see if you win the giveaway! ❤️\nCompetition is open worldwide for the next 48 hours (until Thursday 9pm AEST / 7pm EST). I will contact the winner via DM and comment here within 24 hours of the comp closing. Prize is 1 phone case - in any of the phone models available on Casetify.",

Life’s brutal and beautiful are woven together so tightly that they can’t be separated.\" @glennondoylemelton 💜\n.\nI am seeing this played out so much in my current season of life. So many hard and painful things. But so many beautiful and precious things too. All at once, in the very same moment, or thing that happened. Particularly painful week this week, but so grateful for the beauty amongst it all, grateful for the people who love me and see me. Grateful for all of you and the way we can share a little snippet of our lives through our phones (or whatever you're using to read this). Embrace the brutiful friends. Liss xx",

And as much as I wanted to do it all properly, the idea of doing #allthethings to make a legit amazing font totally terrified me!!!!😜\nNow my friend Teela over at @everytuesday has just released an amazing online course that breaks down alllll the ins and outs of making a font, as well as selling it! I am super excited to work through the course myself, would love to have some of you join me.❤️\nHer course is only open for enrolment for five days, so if this is something you've been thinking of doing, get onto it quick!! Link is in my profile 👉🏼 @lissletters or go to bit.ly/fontmaking\n.\n.\n.\n(This is an affiliate link, which means I make money from any sale made from my link, but the price doesn't change for you. I would never recommend anything to you that I didn't wholeheartedly believe in)",

You don't have to have it all together, no one every actually does anyway - we're all a bit messy and complicated if we're honest.💜\nI've spent most of this morning staring at my computer blankly and trying to decide whether to persist or just crawl back in bed. As a mum who works from home, quiet moments are rare, and the struggle to decide whether to be productive or just lie on the floor and breathe in the silence is real. And while we're being honest, I'll probably do a bit of both today. But I also want to use my child free time to have adult conversations with other women in my life. Anyone else out there trying to cram 20 hours of productivity, some self care and social interaction into 5 hours of child free time??? 😄💜",
