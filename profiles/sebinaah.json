      "description": "I was telling someone yesterday about how as a child, I learnt how to read Arabic but never learnt the meaning of the words. Isn't it strange that so many cultures promote reading the Qu'aran, encourage finishing it from cover to cover in order to please the almighty.. But if you think about it, what is the point in reading an instruction manual or guide book, if you don't understand it? We need to place emphasis on learning, and implementing rather than just reading. It would be more beneficial to take longer to read less, but ensure we understand what we are reading, to enhance our belief, to know why rules are in place and to implement them into our lives. I hope you all have a blessed jummah 😘❤🌸",
