      "description": "31 years ago on April 26,1986 at 1:23 am, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant blew up after operators botched a safety test, triggering an explosion and a fire that burned for 10 days.\n\nRecently, several European newspapers reported that one third of all wild boars hunted in countries in the path of the nuclear fallout such as the Czech Republic and Germany, still contain such high levels of radiation (Cesium-137) that their meat is not save for consumption.\n\nDuring my first visit to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, in the early 1990’s, I photographed scientist from the Department of Ecological Botany at the Swedish University in Uppsala as they worked on a study of tissue radioactivity in animals in the Chernobyl Zone. Their research concentrated on the area's wild boar and roe deer.  After the animals' dissection, then performed in a makeshift lab in a former kindergarten kitchen, their stomach contents were analyzed.\nThis image is from my ongoing project of the Chernobyl disaster and its continuing aftermath.\n\nYou can learn more about Chernobyl from my book and iPad app The Long Shadow of Chernobyl\n\n@natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety #TheLongShadowOfChernobyl #ChernobylAnniversary #nuclear #powerplant #environment #Disaster",

It examined the attitudes and outlooks of young people in Russia, now in their mid-twenties, who were barely ten years old when Putin first became President.\n\nSupporters of the Other Russia, an extremist opposition party, rally in Moscow, displaying flags and armbands with their symbol, a hand grenade. The Other Russia was formed by members of the banned ultranationalist National Bolshevik Party, originally founded by poet Eduard Limonov, but it is not recognized by Putin’s government.\n\n@natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #Russia #Moscow #youth #flags #rally #red #politics #OtherRussia",

The book is now in stores (signed copies from my website), but my project continues. \nIn Los Angeles County there are more than seven million registered vehicles. They work all day to create two of LA’s most infamous commodities: traffic jams and smog. But where do all those cars go to rest? \nBy nature, I am a night owl. In what Kafka called his most productive hours, when dream and reality meet, I go out to photograph sleeping cars. My cars are loners. They command their own space and enjoy showing off their presence. Like a devoted bird watcher I have learned to recognize their sleeping patterns. With voyeuristic pleasure I’ve spied on them in their nightgowns. I’ve watched some sleep in the nude; some take afternoon naps and the few lucky ones get to sleep together. \nA few times the police have stopped me in my work, wondering what I was doing out in the streets in the middle of the night. Was I a Peeping Tom or even worse, a paparazzo? The cars in this project are photographed as I find them, I generally don’t like to disturb them in their slumber. \nFollow @sleepingcars to see many more images of sleeping cars in LA and around the world. \n@natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #SleepingCarsBook #SleepingCars #LosAngeles #mood #car #coveredcar",

      "description": "Over the last 15 years I have made numerous trips to the Salton Sea, photographing for @natgeo, German Geo, for personal projects and I have taught private workshops there.\n\nA victim of geography and hard-ball politics, the Salton Sea is California’s largest, most troubled lake. It lies 227 feet below sea level with no outlets and very thirsty neighbors, including a billion dollar farm economy in the bone-dry Imperial Valley, 124 golf courses in the adjacent Coachella Valley, and salt laden wetlands hosting a menagerie of wildlife in growing crisis.\n\nWith two feeder rivers and no outlet, the water level depends on evaporation, which in return increases the Salton Sea’s salinity. Now a concern is looming.\n\nAlready 25% saltier than the Pacific Ocean, the salinity in the Salton Sea is expected to further increase, potentially killing all of its life and turning it into a biologically dead sea. \nThe photograph above was taken during my 2016 workshop on the Salton Sea. A quietly decaying ship rests on the shores of Bombay Beach. I’m planning to drive to the Salton Sea tomorrow in order to check on the latest developments.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #SaltonSea #California #environment #boat #bombaybeach",

However, today I want to share a gallery of 10 photographs by my dear buddy Douglas Kirkland.  Douglas is one of the greatest Celebrity Photographers in the world – and my best male friend in the USA. He and his wife (and collaborator) Françoise are basically family. While Douglas is best known for his images of Marilyn Monroe, he is comfortable shooting studio portraits, fine art nudes and fashion, to just name a few categories. His career spans over 6 decades, he photographed on countless movie sets and is still working at 82. \nWith his permission I am posting a gallery of images taken from his new book “Freeze Frame: Second Cut” by Glitterati. They offer a glimpse into the most iconic films and lives of celebrities of the last 60 years with photographs that balance glitz and glamour with honesty and insight.\n\nThe 10 photographs in the gallery show Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Judy Garland; Marilyn Monroe; Betty Davis; Katherine Hepburn;Henry Thomas; Meryl Streep; Mariel Hemingway; Angelina Jolie; cover of Freeze Frame; Douglas and Françoise Kirkland\n\n#celebrity #books #douglaskirklandphotography #movies #freezeframe",

      "description": "The sun attempts to break through the autumn morning mist that hangs heavily over the Derwent River valley near New Norfolk.\n\nIn Tasmania, Australia, a 120 mile long river flows from Tasmanian central highlands, through Hobart and into the Tasman Sea. Its banks were once blanketed by forests occupied by aborigines.\n\nRecently, the river has been reported to suffer from pollution due to agricultural runoffs, and by mercury, lead and zinc discharges from various industries. \n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Tasmania #Australia #river #fog #environment #derwent",

      "description": "Here, @kirbase perches on a cornice in Moscow as his friend @balashovenator gets the shot. The 24-year-olds are prominent members of the city's death-defying \"roofer\" community, also called skywalkers. They scale Russia’s highest buildings, without safety gear, often entering illegally, bypassing security and using whatever tools necessary to reach their destinations.  Defiance of authority and the rule of law is in the roofers’ blood and that is why they have fallen under the system’s watch wrote the Moscow Times.\n\nThis photograph opens the gallery of the “Best Photos of 2016” which @natgeo just published. The images were selected from 107 stories by 91 photographers and out of over two million photographs. The photograph here was the opening image of my recent story, The Putin Generation, which ran in the December issue of the National Geographic Magazine. The story examines the attitudes and outlooks of young people, now in their mid-twenties, who were barely ten years old when Putin first became President. \n@thephotosociety @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Russia #Moscow #roofers #skywalkers #spire #architecture #city #rooftops #urban #adventure",

      "description": "The British news publication 'The Independent’ recently reported that the robots sent into Fukushima for cleanup are “dying” at a rate five times higher than expected. Although designed to survive in highly contaminated areas, large amounts of radioactive material are eating away at the robots wiring – rendering them useless.\n\nSix years ago, on March 11, 2011, Japan was hit by one of the most severe earthquakes in recorded history. In the subsequent tsunami the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered serious damage that led to several meltdowns in the nuclear reactor releasing large amounts of radioactive materials. It was the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nThe news of the robots’ malfunction reminded me of the few times I went into the ill-fated Chernobyl reactor - deeper than any Western still photographer.\n\nThe photographs in this gallery were all taken during several short visits deep inside the crumbling Chernobyl reactor. Radiation levels are so high there that both I and the heavily protected workers were only allowed one shift of 15 minutes per day.\n\nMy 20 years covering the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe resulted in the book and iPad App ‘The Long Shadow of Chernobyl’, both available on the store of my website. \n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #chernobyl #ukraine #LongShadowofChernobyl #fukushima #nuclear #disaster #radiation #anniversary",
