I am such a happy and confident person now because of that. 🏃🏽‍♀️I have never felt better 69 weeks into her guides and 43 kilograms down!! 🏋🏽‍♀️ I recommend her guides to anyone and everyone because that girl on the left was drinking/smoking a lot, eating crap and did not exercise. I am the complete opposite now and after for the first time running 15 kilometres last weekend I know anything is possible! You can do it too!!

I'm going to pull up the Google definition....here we go - \"a seven-a-side game in which goals are scored by throwing a ball so that it falls through a netted hoop. By contrast with basketball, a player receiving the ball must stand still until they have passed it to another player\" .....hahahahaha.
