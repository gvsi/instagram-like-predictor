      "description": "We don't usually expect our bodies to perform without proper training, but what about our minds? Do we expect our minds to be focused, strong, and malleable without being trained? \nI can only speak from my own personal experience, but I know my mind tends toward anxiety, depression, and doubt. Alternating between memories of the past stuck on repeat and worrying about what will happen in the future. \nSo what do we do? \nThe journey is different for each of us, but for me it started with training my body, because this is a representation of the mind in a tangible form. \nBy using the breath and awareness of sensation I have been able to strengthen my mind/ body connection. And this is where the real work begins. Using this awareness to choose my thoughts more wisely. I've noticed major progress because things that once would have sent me on a downward spiral no longer bother me. And thoughts that would have haunted me for days can be acknowledged and sometimes even understood- before miraculously being let go. \nI know there's still so much work to be done, but I'm beyond grateful for how far I've come. #yoga \nUpcoming workshops in Richmond VA, Wooster OH, Brooklyn NYC, Seattle WA and more.

      "description": "I just want to help people feel better in their bodies. For a while my yoga practice was fueled by instant gratification. I wanted to do cool poses, and I wanted to do them now. I didn't think much about how my body would feel in 5, 10, or even 50 years, and as a result I injured myself multiple times. \nI wish I could say I am completely past pushing myself, but I'm not. It's still a daily struggle to not have expectations of my body, and to strive for balance instead of depth. But this is the gift I am beginning to be able to share with my students (and myself). To use the practice to bring us closer to balance so that we may find contentment and peace through long term gratification. And through that wake up each day in less pain - whether the pain is physical or emotional. \nThis practice is a tool and we get to decide how we use it. #yoga 📷 @bentleycreativeagency in @aloyoga",
