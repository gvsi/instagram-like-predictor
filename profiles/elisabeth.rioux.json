      "description": "Here is our little baby 😍 her name is Royce, she is a siberian husky of 2 month. We think she is mixed with a malamute but we're not sure, Royce was on a place not really legit.. They told us she was vaccinated and dewormed, we believed it since we didnt know anything about dogs, its our first one, but that day we didnt take her since we are only getting our new condo on may 25. Than my friend taught me that if she was vaccinated and dewormed, she should have a health book but the guy was like \"she doesnt have it, we did the vaccine ourselves...\" we called a vet and she said it is impossible, it would be possible if they were a vet but she still would have a health book. We asked many questions to the guy, the place where she was staying was a really dirty and small appartment, the guy NEVER answered our questions, he also lied to us (you will see the complete history in our next vlogs). I couldnt believe it. I was so sad for her caus she is so beautiful and if a baby puppy don't get her vaccine and is not dewormed it can literally die, it will suffer alot. We didnt want people like us who doesnt know anything to adopt her and never be warned, and then Royce would have suffer from it and also might have bring diseases to other animals.. we went directly take her, I brought her to my parents house and they accepted her, she will be in her new house with her parents (jonathan and I) on may 25 ❤️ we will be a lovely family, and then she will also have a little sister or brother, we dont know yet 💕 so this is how our family starts, hope you are not sad it's not a baby, anyway how can you be sad while looking at Royce 🙊 We are living our life steps by steps, i need to finish my university before having a human baby, but for now we have this little baby and we are more than happy to be its parents 🙏🏽",

      "description": "Small nose, small cheeks, big lips, big eyes, on fleek eyebrows, perfect teeth, long eyelashes, strong jawline.... those are the things people are looking at on instagram, those are the things girls want because of the beauty standards at the moment. I used to look at myself and hope to have those caracteristics, probably some of you still do but I wanted to make you realise something I realised : I have big cheeks, Claudia tihan doesnt have the \"perfect\" smile, savannah montano has a \"big\" nose, alexis ren doesn't have the \"perfect\" eyebrows, ariana grande has small eyes, etc etc , I could name so many girls like that. If you see this as  insults, you just don't understand what I am trying to say. I want you to realise that this is the girls you (me include) look up to, they are all perfect to me and probably to you too even if they don't have all of those caracteristics so why can't you be ? The thing those girls have is : CONFIDENCE ! Confidence is the key, getting all of these caracteristic wont make you more beautiful but being confident will, trust me ✨ I read something from a girl on instagram yesterday, she will recognize herself, and it made me think about me before I realized that so I was not the only one thinking like that so I made her realize who she is and what she worth and now I want all of you to realize it 🙏🏽",
