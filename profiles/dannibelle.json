      "description": "This is your friendly reminder to stretch post-workout ✌️I always say \"I'll stretch at home\" which very very verryyyy rarely happens. So just do it straight after your workout to help reduce muscle soreness and fatigue. Stretching also improves flexibility, circulation, range of motion and assists muscle recovery. In conclusion: very important, make sure you stretch ✌️ Have a great day\n\nP.S. This photo is not a stretching pose, just a regular \"I'm too tired to stand up for a selfie\" pose. Ok bye for real this time ✌️",

      "description": "I think it’s time for everyone to start being a little less critical of their own bodies. I have stretch marks, small breasts and cellulite. I’m not getting treatment nor am I getting anything enhanced. I don’t see any of these things as flaws.. I mean you can’t spell cellulite without 'u lit.' I’m currently working on improving my fitness, not because I want to look a certain way but because I want to feel strong. I have already received messages telling me I should get breast surgery because my breasts have gotten smaller. I’m not entirely sure why my body is their business but hey, it’s social media. I put myself out there to a large audience and I’m likely to get some negative feedback. Unfortunately they won't be able to read this because they've been blocked. I'm not putting up with negativity. Social media can be so misleading so I’m putting this message out to everyone who feels insecure. I’m not changing myself to fit a mould and neither should you. Be yourself, do it fearlessly. Remember, you have to spend the rest of your life with yourself so start loving your awkwardness, your talents, your humour, your shape, your stretch marks, your cellulite and everything that makes you unique. Self acceptance is a journey. Appreciate how far you’ve come and have faith in how far you will go ❤",

      "description": "Allow yourself to be a beginner. I remember being so intimidated to workout in the gym... I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t want to make a fool of myself. But the thing is, we all feel nervous when we’re taken out of our comfort zone. But outside of the comfort zone is where the magic happens. Don’t be afraid to try something new and push yourself because strength doesn’t come from what you can do, it comes from overcoming the things you thought you couldn’t. This post is to let you know that I was once nervous, unconfident and a beginner, but now I’m learning and growing stronger each day. You can do it, you just need to take the first step. I have been posting videos of my workouts and will continue to show you my different routines in the gym, outdoors and at home so you can start taking control of your fitness journey and smashing your goals 👊 Will it be easy? No. Will it be worth it? Absolutely.",
