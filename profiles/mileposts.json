      "description": "Nine. When you are 9 months pregnant nine feels like an ETERNITY....yet some how 9 years just flashed by in an instant. When I was little if you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I would have told you - I wanted to be a mom 💙 I imagined I'd have a little brown haired boy with brown eyes but God surprised me with the cutest little blonde haired, blue-eyed thing. Like his sister before him, he wasn't planned, he just showed up 💙 and oh how thankful I am that he did. Happy 9th Birthday to my favorite little man Miles 💙 p.s. I am reminded every single year that this day 9 years ago was the most painful day of my life - worth it but holy heck. It altered the course of my running because from that day forward I knew what REAL pain was and was able to run a BQ time of 3:36 - 6 months after he was born 😜 a marathon is easy peasy compared to childbirth! 😉😘 #mileslincoln #thisis9",
