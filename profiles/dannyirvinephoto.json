I'm glad that I did as there was still a bit of colour left in the sky.

I wasn't there to shoot and I didn't get much of a chance to either but I did get this awesome sunset shot when I arrived on the Thursday. St Kilda has a real nice vibe to the place and I loved shooting across the timber promenade. Not to mention the awesome crazy colour in the sky. The layering of texture is what I really love about this shot. Its one of my favourites that I have taken for quite some time.\n—————————————————————————\n🔸Next Mini Workshop May 28th 2017 -  LINK IN BIO🔸\n—————————————————————————\nPHOTO WORKSHOPS:\nBook a Photography or Photoshop Workshop. \nJoin an overseas Photo Tour.
