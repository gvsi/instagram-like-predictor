Then I spent it doing one of my favourite things in the world: Filming for Guide To Life!!! 😎 Plus it's extra special because the day I turn 33 was spent filming for the 200th episode of Guide to Life, and we spent 24hrs awake to chat and interact with all our most loyal viewers!! 😌😌😌 It was so so so fun and I'm so glad I got to speak with the whole lot of you especially Icarus, Go go, missamik, Fae... and all those I didn't mention who came to watch too. Plus this time you guys can finally meet Gillian and Dan who are behind the scenes of the GTL episodes you watch. The 24hrs is finally over but exhausted as I am I didn't want it to end. 😭\n.\nThanks to @samanthathavasa.sg who let me meet their new ambassadors in the Samantha Thavasa flagship store and interview them: @sofiarichie (in pic), @sarahfuckingsnyder, @lottiemossxo and @kenyakinskij!\n.\nAlthough I didn't spend my birthday with my family it's ok because in 2 days I'm bringing Dash to @hkdisneyland and Daddy + Popo + Dash recorded me a sweet happy birthday song! 🎈🎂\n.\nFlying home today and feeling really really loved and very grateful for all that I have in my life 😭 .\nAnd thank you to everyone who sent me birthday wishes!!! Love ya guys!!!! #happy",

I don't know what the fuck happened because I sure as hell didn't delete it. 😡 The error message said it is deleted by user but I wasn't hacked or anything?! I really hope it wasn't like taken down because it is too controversial or something. 😳\n\nI lost 20,000 initial views and over 500 comments. Very irritated!! Anyway here it is again so quick watch it just in case it's gone again. 😒\n\nClick on link in bio or go to https://youtu.be/bVspgkYbJl4\n\nPs: If you have something against women who are not feminist, I suggest you watch the video first before insulting me here. Otherwise you just appear rather misinformed.",

      "description": "(Super value sale below) We've all been through that stage where our body hair makes us insecure - but if you don't like something and it's within your power, why not change it? 🙋🏼 Old-school waxing and tweezing can be so inconvenient and painful. Worse still, it damages the surface of your skin! Shaving is just really troublesome and the hair that grows out is so course and prickly! Why go through something like that when you can remove your hair painlessly and quickly - plus your hair will NEVER grow back as coarse or as thick? @datsumolabosg S.S.C. Light Therapy is so comfortable with their advanced machinery and special gel, all you feel is a warm sensation. No pain!! Work towards long-term smooth skin without any unwanted hair! For the month of April, they're having a 1-FOR-1 promotion for their TRIAL starting from ONLY $29! That means you can double your areas or bring a friend to try! Quote my name \"XIAXUE\" for an EXTRA 5% OFF Any Package! Book at datsumo-labo.com.sg/trial now! #sp #smoothskincontrol #datsumolabosg #hairremoval",
